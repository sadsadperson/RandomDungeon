We have seen the destruction in Kakavia from the gate. Trekker and Coyote, or two youngest and wildest warriors wanted to fight. I too wanted to go and protect our land, not just to keep you, my son safe, but also our kingdom’s heritage. 
I know however, that I cannot leave my post. Should I leave this place, the Ghouls will eventually reach it, and they will begin to destroy the spells that William and Ferric had created. Once that is accomplished they will have access to the mortal realm, and that will bring much more destruction then Zigor’s attack. 
Still, I must admit I can barely bear the thought of it, knowing they are burning and slaughtering, I have to remind myself every second of how much greater the destruction would be if I left my post. 
You may think I do not love you, or do not care enough to protect you and my country my son, but it is for those two reasons that I remain here guarding my post and do not fight to protect Kakavia. 
Still, Ferric speaks of a power in Death’s castle, the source of the river of magic that we may be able to use to destroy him. Death knows this is the only thing that can defeat him and therefore he built his castle to protect it. 
It is trapped deep beneath his fortress in a maze of his own monstrous creation. 
Should we decide to go after it, I will be one of the ones to look for it. I’m one of the smaller warriors and I’m not afraid of the dark underground tunnels we will face. I wonder how Ferric would fare should he come.
I must stop writing now, Trekker says that a horde of Ghouls is approaching the gate and we must fight them off. 
Know that I love you David. For that reason I must stay at my post.
